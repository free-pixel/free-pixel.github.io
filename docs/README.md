English | [简体中文](README-ZH_CN.md) | [繁體中文](README-ZH_HANS.md)

PixelClock is a Pomodoro timer app designed to help you boost productivity. You can customize your Pomodoro timer with work durations, task details, break times, and long break times.

After completing 4 Pomodoros, PixelClock will automatically trigger a long break, allowing you to relax and recharge.

**Key Features:**

- **Custom Time Settings**: Adjust work time, short break time, and long break time according to your needs.
- **Progress Sync Display**: The progress bar in the Mac menu bar synchronizes with the timer. As time progresses, the red progress bar gradually fills the circle, providing a real-time reflection of your work progress.
- **Long Break Reminder**: After completing 4 Pomodoros, the app will automatically start a long break to help you maintain a balanced and efficient work pace.

**WARNNING**

I'm currently building an application on the Mac OS version 15.4.1 . If the application fails to run properly, you can 
clone the code repository and perform the compilation operation on your own.
